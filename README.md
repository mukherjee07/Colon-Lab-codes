# Colon-Lab-codes
This repository presents all codes created by Krishnendu Mukherjee (2nd year CBE PhD) at his time in the colon lab. They includes:
1. Job submission and input files for individual simulation (both Qchem and molecular simulations)
2. Extraction scripts (extracting relevant data such as potential energy, water uptake, heat of adsorption etc.) from thousands of output files and arrange them in a CSV format.
3. Python post-processing and data analysis.
4. Creating intermediate simulation data objects such as Idealized structures, models, Latin hypercube sampled structures etc.
